In Mountain View, the skies are blue,  
Silicon whispers in the morning dew.  

Tech dreams soar where the hills arise,  
Underneath a blanket of starry skies.  

Golden light on El Caminoâ€™s path,  
Nature and progress in a gentle dance. ğŸŒ„  

Where the future meets the old and new,  
Mountain View, a vision come true.
